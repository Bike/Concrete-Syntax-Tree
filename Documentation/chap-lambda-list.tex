\chapter{Parsing lambda lists}
\label{chap-user-parsing-lambda-lists}

The \sysname{} library contains a framework for parsing lambda lists.
This framework contains functions for parsing the types of lambda
lists that specified in the \commonlisp{} standard, but it also
contains a protocol that allows different implementations to specify
additional lambda-list keywords, and to specify how lambda lists
containing these additional keywords should be parsed.

\section{Classes for grammar symbols}

\Defclass {grammar-symbol}

This class is the root of all grammar-symbol classes.

\Defclass {parameter-group}

This class is the root class of all classes that represent parameter
groups.  It is a subclass of the class \texttt{grammar-symbol}.

\Definitarg {:children}

This initialization argument can be used with all subclasses of the
class named \texttt{parameter-group}.  For parameter groups that have
no lambda-list keywords, such as all the parameter groups
corresponding to required parameters, the value of the argument is a
(possibly empty) list of parameters.  For parameter groups that have
associated lambda-list keywords, the value of the argument includes
those lambda-list keywords in addition to the parameters themselves.

\Defclass {singleton-parameter-group-mixin}

This class is used as a superclass of all classes representing
parameter groups with a keyword followed by a single parameter.

\Definitarg {:parameter}

This initialization argument can be used with subclasses of the class
named \texttt{singleton-parameter-group-mixin}, but the parser does
not use it.  Instead, it passes the \texttt{:children} initialization
argument.  An appropriate \texttt{:after} method on
\texttt{initialize-instance} splits the children into the lambda-list
keyword itself and the single following parameter.

\Defgeneric {parameter} {singleton-parameter-group-mixin}

This generic function returns a concrete syntax tree representing the
single parameter of its argument.

\Defclass {multi-parameter-group-mixin}

This class is used as a superclass of all classes representing
parameter groups with or without a keyword followed by a (possibly
empty) list of parameters.

\Definitarg {:parameters}

This initialization argument can be used with subclasses of the class
named \texttt{multi-parameter-group-mixin}, but the parser does
not use it.  Instead, it passes the \texttt{:children} initialization
argument.  An appropriate \texttt{:after} method on
\texttt{initialize-instance} computes this initialization argument
from the children.

\Defgeneric {parameters} {multi-parameter-group-mixin}

This generic function returns a list of concrete syntax trees
representing the parameters of its argument.

\Defclass {implicit-parameter-group}

This class is the root class of all classes that represent parameter
groups that are \emph{not} introduced by a lambda-list keyword, which
is all the different classes representing required parameter groups.

This class is a subclass of the class named \texttt{parameter-group}
and the class named \texttt{multi-parameter-group-mixin}.

\Defclass {explicit-parameter-group}

This class is the root class of all classes that represent parameter
groups that \emph{are} introduced by a lambda-list keyword.

This class is a subclass of the class \texttt{parameter-group}.

\Definitarg {:keyword}

This initialization argument can be used with subclasses of the class
named \texttt{explicit-parameter-group}, but the parser does not use
it.  Instead, it passes the \texttt{:children} initialization
argument.  An appropriate \texttt{:after} method on
\texttt{initialize-instance} computes this initialization argument
from the children.

\Defgeneric {keyword} {explicit-parameter-group}

This generic function returns the lambda-list keyword of its argument.

\Defclass {explicit-multi-parameter-group}

This class is the root class of all classes that represent parameter
groups that are introduced by a lambda-list keyword, and that can take
an arbitrary number of parameters.

This class is a subclass of the class named
\texttt{explicit-parameter-group} and of the class named
\texttt{multi-parameter-group-mixin}

This class is the root class of all classes representing optional
parameter groups.

It is a subclass of the class \texttt{explicit-multi-parameter-group}.

\Defclass {ordinary-optional-parameter-group}

This class represents the list of optional parameters in all lambda
lists that allow for an optional parameter to have a form representing
the default value and a \texttt{supplied-p} parameter.

This class is a subclass of the class \texttt{explicit-parameter-group}.

\Defclass {key-parameter-group}

This class is the root class of all parameter groups that are
introduced by the lambda-list keyword \texttt{\&key}.

This class is a subclass of the class \texttt{explicit-parameter-group}.

\Defgeneric {allow-other-keys} {key-parameter-group}

This function can be called on any instance of the class
\texttt{key-parameter-group}.  If the lambda-list keyword
\texttt{\&allow-other-keys} is present in this key parameter group,
then \texttt{allow-other-keys} returns a concrete syntax
tree for that lambda-list keyword.  If the lambda-list keyword
\texttt{\&allow-other-keys} is \emph{not} present, this function
returns \texttt{nil}.

\Defclass {ordinary-key-parameter-group}

This class represents the list of \texttt{\&key} parameters in all
lambda lists that allow for the parameter to have a form representing
the default value and a \texttt{supplied-p} parameter.

generic-function lambda list.  This type of lambda list only allows
for the parameter to have a variable name.

This class is a subclass of the class \texttt{explicit-parameter-group}.

\Defclass {specialized-required-parameter-group}

This class represents the list of required parameters in a specialized
lambda list, i.e., the type of lambda list that can be present in a
\texttt{defmethod} definition.  In this type of lambda list, a
required parameter may optionally have a \emph{specializer} associated
with it.

This class is a subclass of the class \texttt{implicit-parameter-group}.

\Defclass {destructuring-required-parameter-group}

This class represents the list of required parameters in a destructuring
lambda list, i.e. the kind of lambda list that can be present in a
\texttt{defmacro} definition, both as the top-level lambda list and as
a nested lambda list where this is allowed.

This class is a subclass of the class \texttt{implicit-parameter-group}.

In order to have a grammar that is possible to use for parsing a
lambda list, in addition to the rules for all the lambda list types
