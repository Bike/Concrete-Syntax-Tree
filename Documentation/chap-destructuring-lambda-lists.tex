\chapter{Destructuring lambda lists}
\label{chap-destructuring-lambda-lists}

When applied to lambda lists, the term ``destructuring'' means to
match its parameters against an argument list, and to generate a set
of nested \texttt{let} bindings.  A binding will bind a parameter of
the lambda list to its corresponding value in the argument list, or it
will bind some temporary variable.  The argument list is not known at
the time of the destructuring, so the \emph{form} of each binding will
consist of calls to destructuring functions such as \texttt{car} and
\texttt{cdr}, starting with a variable that holds the entire argument
list as its value.

This kind of destructuring is used at macro-expansion time when
certain macros are expanded.  In particular \texttt{defmacro} and
\texttt{define-compiler-macro}.  The result of the destructuring is a
\texttt{lambda} expression for the \emph{macro function}.  This lambda
expression is then compiled to create the final macro function.
